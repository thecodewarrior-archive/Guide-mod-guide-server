The mushroom is a fungi and comes in two different colors, red and brown. Red mushrooms are red with white spots and have a white trunk. Brown mushrooms are a medium tan, also with a white trunk.

 A mushroom can be grown in light levels below 13 and not directly under the sky. If planted on a <guide href="minecraft:mycelium">Mycelium</guide> block or a <guide href="minecraft:podzol">Podzol</guide> block, a mushroom will stay planted in any light level and under open sky. Both types of mushroom, red and brown, grow and spread at the same rate on <guide href="minecraft:mycelium">Mycelium</guide> or <guide href="minecraft:podzol">Podzol</guide>. Mushrooms will spread onto nearby block if in appropriate conditions. They will spread only if there are less than 5 mushrooms of the same type in a 9x9x3 block area.

Mushrooms may spawn in the  <guide href="minecraft:overworld">Overworld</guide> , in the <guide href="minecraft:biomes/mushroom_island">Mushroom island</guide> biome, and in the <guide href="minecraft:nether">Nether</guide>. 

Besides being mined directly, a mushroom will be dropped as an item if:

- The block below them falls, is moved, or is destroyed. 
- A fluid flows over them.
- It is above light level 12 and a block updates next to them.

Brown mushrooms emit a barely visible light level of 1.
