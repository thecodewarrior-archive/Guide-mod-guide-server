The main difference between Cobblestone walls and <guide href="minecraft:fence">Fences</guide> is purely cosmetic, and the "pillar" part of the cobblestone wall only appears at the ends, corners, or intersections. Not on every block.

Cobblestone walls act almost exactly like <guide href="minecraft:fence">Fences</guide>, with two differences, they have higher <guide href="minecraft:blast_resistance">Blast Resistance</guide> than fences, and when there are two placed diagonally from each other, the player can't walk between them.

Cobblestone walls come in two varieties, Cobblestone Walls, and Mossy Cobblestone Walls
