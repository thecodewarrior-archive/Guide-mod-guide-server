Probably the cheapest building material in Minecraft, Cobblestone is dropped when <guide href="minecraft:stone">stone</guide> is broken with a <guide href="minecraft:pickaxe">pickaxe</guide> unless the pickaxe is <guide href="minecraft:enchant">enchanted</guide> with <guide href="minecraft:silkTouch">silk touch</guide>.

Cobblestone can be created when <guide href="minecraft:water">water</guide> flows into flowing <guide href="minecraft:lava">lava</guide>, however, if the lava flows onto the water, it will create <guide href="minecraft:stone">stone</guide> instead.

Notable things that are made using cobblestone:
