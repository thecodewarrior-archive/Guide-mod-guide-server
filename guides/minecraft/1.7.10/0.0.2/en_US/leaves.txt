Leaves naturally spawn on trees, and will decay slowly if all <guide href="minecraft:wood_log">logs</guide> within 4 blocks are removed, leaves have a chance of dropping <guide href="minecraft:sapling">saplings</guide> when broken or when they decay, if leaves are collected with <guide href="minecraft:shear">Shears</guide>, they will be dropped in block form and won't decay when placed.

Note:
Oak leaves have a chance of dropping <guide href="minecraft:apple">apples</guide> when broken or when they decay.
