This block spawns at the bottom of the <guide href="minecraft:overworld">Overworld</guide>, plus the top and bottom of the <guide href="minecraft:nether">Nether</guide>.

Bedrock is impossible to destroy by typical means, the only way to destroy it is to grow a dark oak above it, and the "roots" will occasionally dig through the bedrock.
