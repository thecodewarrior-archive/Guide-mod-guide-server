There are five tool materials in minecraft, each of which is used to make tools of varying strength and speed, and they are as follows.

<guide href="minecraft:planks">Wood</guide>
<indent>
Wood tools are used mainly very <guide href="minecraft:early_late_mid_game">early-game</guide>, as they are the bottom of the list of materials.
</indent>

<guide href="minecraft:cobblestone">Stone</guide>
<indent>
Stone tools are the second tier of tools, and are also used mainly very <guide href="minecraft:early_late_mid_game">early-game</guide>.
</indent>

<guide href="minecraft:iron">Iron</guide>
<indent>
Iron tools are your mid-tier tools, they have decent durability and speed, and are all around pretty good tools.
</indent>

<guide href="minecraft:gold">Gold</guide>
<indent>
Pretty much the least useful tools in Minecraft, gold tools are extremely fast, but have barely more than half the durability of Wood tools.
</indent>

<guide href="minecraft:diamond">Diamond</guide>
<indent>
The best tool material by far, diamond tools have far more durability than any other material, and are also far faster. The only problem is that diamonds are rare.
