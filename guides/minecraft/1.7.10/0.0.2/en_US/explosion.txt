An explosion is a physical event, generally destructive, that can be caused by several different circumstances. It can destroy nearby blocks, propel and <guide href="minecraft:damage">damage</guide> nearby <guide href="minecraft:player">players</guide>, <guide href="minecraft:entity">entities</guide>, and their <guide href="minecraft:armor">armor</guide>, and cause one or more <guide href="minecraft:fire">fires</guide> under correct circumstances. Explosions produce a "shockwave" <guide href="minecraft:particle_event">particle effect</guide>.

Multiple close explosions may propel objects further, but have no cumulative effect on the destruction of a block. This is because explosions' damage to blocks is evaluated individually (per explosion), and blocks' <guide href="minecraft:blast_resistance">blast resistance</guide> does not become "weakened" per explosion.

"Destroyed" blocks have a chance of dropping as collectible resources (and otherwise disappear), and this chance is one divided by the explosion power. So, a creeper blast (uncharged) will have a 1/3 chance of dropping a block.
