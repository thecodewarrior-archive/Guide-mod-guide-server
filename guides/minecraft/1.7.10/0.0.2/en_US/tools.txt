Tools are, well, tools. They allow the player to mine more quickly, kill mobs more quickly, or do things the player normally can't.

All tools have durability, which is used up when the tool is used, when the durability gets to zero the tool will break, playing a sound and disappearing.

All tools can be combined in a crafting table with one tool of the same type and material to add their durabilities, plus a bonus 5%.

Note: Pickaxes, Axes, Shovels, Swords, and Hoes can be made using any of the <guide href="minecraft:toolMaterial">tool materials</guide>
