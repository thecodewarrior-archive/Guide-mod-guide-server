Formerly known as Netherstone, Netherrack is a red and black rock-like block found in the nether. It can only be collected with a pickaxe, and if it is destroyed with any other tool no item will drop.

Netherrack makes up most of the <guide href="minecraft:nether">Nether's</guide> terrain. 

When a Netherrack's top is lit on fire, it burns infinitely.
