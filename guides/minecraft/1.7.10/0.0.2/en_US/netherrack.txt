Netherrack

Formerly known as Netherstone, Netherrack is a red and black rock-like block found in the nether. It can only be collected with a pickaxe, and if it is destroyed with any other tool no item will drop.

Netherrack makes up most of the <<guide:Nether's|minecraft:nether>> terrain. 

When a Netherrack's top is lit on fire, it burns infinitely.
