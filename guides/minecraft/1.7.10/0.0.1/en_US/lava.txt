Lava

Lava is one of two <<guide:liquids|minecraft:liquid>> in vanilla minecraft and is found in underground pools at <<guide:levels|minecraft:z-level>> 1 through 10 and rarely on the surface as lakes or lava-falls.

Lava will light the player on fire if touched and will destroy items if they land in it.

Lava emits a <<guide:light level|minecraft:light>> of 15

Lava can be stopped from flowing by ladders, fences, and signs, without them lighting on fire and being destroyed.

Shooting an arrow through flowing lava (though not source blocks) will light the arrow on fire, causing it to light any mob it hits on fire

Interactions between Lava and Water

If lava flows on top of still or running water, it creates stone.
If lava flows horizontally into water, cobblestone is created.
If water flows horizontally into lava, a hiss and puff of smoke occur but nothing changes.
If water flows vertically into lava, cobblestone or a hiss may result.
If water flows into a lava source block then obsidian is created. The lava spring is destroyed in the process, so unlike cobblestone it is not continuous and renewable.
If vertically falling water touches a lava source block on any side obsidian is created - even if the water would not run into the lava's square.
